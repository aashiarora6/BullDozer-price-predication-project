# BullDozer-price-predication-project

So since last couple of days I was working on a Bulldozer-price-predication model
basically this was a contest on kaggle launched before 8 years!!!
I was given 3 sets of data...
training set of data, validation set of data and ofcourse test data
it required me to use rmsle model initially gave 0.2555, then I did hyperparameter tunning using RandomizedSearchCV!!!!After trying infinite iterations for almost 2 hours i found my ideal
paramters which gave me a score narrowing down to 0.2460

Now it was time for me to start running my predications on the test data!!! nd finally I just made a model with score 0.2460!!nd atleast I also calculated the feature importance of my evaluated best model!!!!
